# **MAIN HEADING: DATASET OBSERVATIONS**
# - This section contains observations and insights derived from the dataset.

## **1. Missing Values**
# - the only missing values in the dataset are found in the 'cuisines' column, with 9 missing entries.
# - other columns like 'restaurant name', 'country', 'city', 'average cost for two', and 'rating' do not have missing data.

## **2. Country Distribution**
# - india has the highest number of restaurants listed in the dataset.
# - other notable countries include the united states and the united kingdom, but india dominates the dataset.
# - the dataset seems to primarily represent the indian restaurant market, with significant presence in other countries.

## **3. Dataset Merging**
# - the zomato dataset was successfully merged with the 'country-code.xlsx' file to add the 'country' column.
# - this helps in associating each restaurant with its respective country, which will aid in country-based analysis.

## **4. Visualizations**
